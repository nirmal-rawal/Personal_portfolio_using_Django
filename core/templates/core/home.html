        I've worked on various projects, both in my studies and on my own, 
        where I've sharpened my skills in Python, Django, and FastAPI.
        I've also dived into data science and machine learning.
        I'm good at building strong, scalable backend systems and have a 
        solid grasp of managing databases, especially with 
        PostgreSQL.
